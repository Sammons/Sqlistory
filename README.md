Sqlistory
=========

Node js app that lets the user run sqlite queries against their browser history

if you are new to node, go find and install it for your OS as well as NPM

navigate to the repository clone, and type npm install -- npm should snag dependencies for you

run "node server.js" and view it @ localhost:3000
